Geopollinator
=============

##The problem:
Geopolitics is a social studies course which requires students to
memorize/learn the countries in the world. The difficulty with this
is that most websites which offer a way to study countries, either do
not have all the countries for one test, and require a student to study
part of one test and part of another; or they are simply not specific
enough in the maps to cover all the countries covered by the class.

##Our Solution:
Create a website that uses a map and prompts the user, asking, "Where
is this country?" and a point-and-click method of finding those
countries. You will be able to choose which countries that you would
like to study. 

##Our visual will be as follows:
The home screen will have a select list of commonly studied country
groups (Europe, Middle East etc.). When coming to the correct URL, it will have a country selection list, 
and the user will select 
which countries they wish to study. Based on the farthest to the left,
to the right, down, and up it will set the area that the program zooms in
on. If the country is smaller than a certain size, and the user misses
it, an arrow will point and the area immediately around the country
will glow. The user will have a zoom option, and a scroll bar on the side.
This is so that the user can select smaller countries if they are
studying over a large area. Areas studied can be saved as study
groups which will be stored as cookies in the users browsers. 
[Is there some kind of score keeping involved and how would that work?]

[There is enough functionality in this following sentence to fill
an entire section with more detail. Is it realistic to think you
will accomplish this at all?]Key
maps and study lists will be available on another few tabs these will
be for teachers, suggest country lists to study as well as pages to
print out and test their students on. [What are "key maps" and "study lists"
and are they integrated somehow with the rest of the site? That is, are 
there clickable links in them and what do they do? What "pages to print
out" are there, exactly? Seems like a lot of extras!]
